Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

for self-checking their submission.
To play the game open a browser and click File/Open File. Open the file Index.html.
Play the classic arcade game frogger.  Try and make it to the top by without getting hit by the bugs.  Careful-each time you hit one is -5 points.  Making it to the water is worth 5 points.  When you make it to the water, the player reverts back to the beginning for another try. And another and another because you will be addicted by this point.
To move the Player simply use the arrow keys on your keyboard.
Good Luck!
